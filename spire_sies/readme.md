## SPIRE-SIES CORPUS

SPIRE-SIES provides 166 hours of annotated Indian English spontaneous 
speech data. This corpus is crowd-sourced from 1567 speakers belonging
to varied 18 Indian nativities, genders and age groups. Traditional
spontaneous speech collection strategies involve capturing of speech
during interviewing or conversations. But, we use images as stimuli
to induce spontaneity in speech. Transcripts are intially generated
from WHISPER and then validated manually over multiple rounds.

## Images (Stimuli): IISc_SPIRE_SIES_Images

This is a subset of flicker-40k image captioning database. We take 1k images from 
flicker-40k which were given to the speakers as stimuli inducing spontaneity in speech.
Five variations of captions for images are provided under: IISc_SPIRE_SIES_Image_Captions.csv
