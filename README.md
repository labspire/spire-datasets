## Overview
This repository contains corpus information for various datasets curated by SPIRE Lab as part of multiple research and development initiatives. To explore a specific dataset, navigate to its corresponding folder. Each folder includes a `README.md` file with detailed information about the dataset. For datasets with multiple `README` files, sub-folders are organized hierarchically, ensuring each child folder has its own `README.md` file for better clarity and understanding.

You can download the datasets from [SPIRE Datasets Portal](https://spiredatasets.ee.iisc.ac.in/).
